# Notes

- Remember int sizes in JS due to how 64-bit floating point numbers are handled.  The large interger node list threw an error because of max int size.  `BigInt` can work in place of `Number` but there are better solutions that can be done.
- Memorize how to make a NodeList class for JS.
- Feel comfy writing while loops to traverse NodeLists backwards or forwards as needed.
