# Notes

- My brain went to nested array solution first thing.  Remember to think if I can rephrase the question to be `target - num = goal` instead of `num1 + num1 = target` meaning it changes how I can write the code better or tackle the problem efficiently.
- Nested loops are a good case to remember that Hash Maps are prolly a better way to do lookups on whatever I'm doing and are way more efficient.
- I overcomplicated the problem because I have a habit of thinking of a solution before finishing reading the entire prompt.  I ignored `each input has exactly one solution` which woulda made my early return way easier to code ffs.
